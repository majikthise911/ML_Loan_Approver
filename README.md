## Loan Approver
In this exercise I have built a logistic regression model that can be used to predict the loan status (approve or deny) given a set of input features.

### Instructions

1. Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame
2. Separate the features (X) from the target (y). In this case, the loan status is the target.
3. Separate the data into training and testing.
4. Create a logistic regression classifier using sklearn.
5. Fit the model to the data.
6. Calculate the accuracy score using both the training and the testing data.
7. Make predictions using the testing data.
8. Generate the confusion matrix for the test data predictions.
9. Generate the classification report for the test data.
